: What is the purpose of the OSI model?
A: It helps understand and standardize how different networking functions communicate in layers, allowing interoperability between devices and protocols.
Layer 1 deals with the physical aspects of the network, such as cabling and signal transmission. Layer 2 focuses on framing data and communication within a local network segment, using MAC addresses. Layer 3 handles logical addressing (IP addresses) and routing data between different networks
