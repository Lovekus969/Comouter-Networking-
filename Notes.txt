: What is the purpose of the OSI model?
A: It helps understand and standardize how different networking functions communicate in layers, allowing interoperability between devices and protocols.
Layer 1 deals with the physical aspects of the network, such as cabling and signal transmission. Layer 2 focuses on framing data and communication within a local network segment, using MAC addresses. Layer 3 handles logical addressing (IP addresses) and routing data between different networks

Q.. firewall security in computer networks 
A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
Its main job: allow good traffic, block bad traffic — like a security guard at your network’s entrance.

Q..Where is a Firewall Used?
Between your internal network (LAN) and the public internet
Between different segments of a network (e.g., office to data center)
In cloud platforms like AWS, Azure (via Security Groups or NACLs)

Q.. What is an IDS?
IDS = Intrusion Detection System
It's a security tool that monitors network traffic or system behavior to detect suspicious or malicious activity — like a network security camera. It doesn’t block anything itself — it just detects, alerts, and logs.

Q.. What is IPS?
(IPS = Intrusion Prevention System.) An IPS not only detects threats like an IDS, but also acts immediately to stop them — it’s like having a security guard who tackles the intruder before harm is done.
